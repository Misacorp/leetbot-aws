# Architecture

Leetbot needs to sit in a Discord server every day within the time window `]13:36, 13:39[`. This could be accomplished in a few different ways including

1. Running an EC2 instance for those 3 minutes.
2. âœ… Running a Lambda for those 3 minutes. (Current implementation)
3. Starting a Fargate container for those 3 minutes.

## Lambda Layers

The Discord SDK is installed on a Lambda Layer in `lib/constructs/DiscordSdkLambdaLayer.ts`. For each Lambda function that wants to use the Discord API, the Layer should be given in the function definition.

```ts
new NodejsFunction(this, "MyNodejsFunction", {
  layers: [
    lambda.LayerVersion.fromLayerVersionArn(
      this,
      "ImportedDiscordSdkLambdaLayer",
      props.layer.layer.layerVersionArn,
    ),
  ],
  // ...other NodejsFunction configuration...
});
```

The Discord SDK can then be used in each Lambda handler from `/opt/nodejs/discordSdkLayer`. This is because Lambda functions mount their layers in the `/opt` directory.

```ts
import { discordSdkLayer } from "/opt/nodejs/discordSdkLayer";
```

# Development

The stack itself is located in the `lib` directory.

# Deployment

> If you are using [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault), prefix pretty much every command here with `aws-vault exec <your-role-name> -- <command>`

Run `npm run aws:deploy` to deploy the application.

Each `CfnOutput` will be saved to a `cdk-outputs.json` file, should you need to reference them.

## Deployment Troubleshooting

### No bucket named `xyz`. Is account `123` bootstrapped?

Fix this by doing one of the following:

#### Option 1: CLI

Run this script: `npm run aws:unbootstrap`

#### Option 2: AWS Management Console

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Cloudformation.
2. Delete the `CDKToolkit` stack.
3. Run `npx cdk bootstrap`.

Finally, re-bootstrap the environment with `npm run aws:bootstrap`. Deployment should work now.
